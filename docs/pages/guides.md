## Poor Man's PC (<$300)

A very basic gaming PC can be constructed from any OEM office PC, such as a Dell Optiplex, HP Envy, etc. These are readily available on used marketplaces for as little as around $100 for something decent.

**Oftentimes, these PCs don't come with dedicated graphics.** So, to convert these into gaming PCs, try finding a used graphics card to put inside of it. Some good options are:

### For Non Dedicated Power:
(i.e.: You don't need to connect a PSU cable to it, as many OEMs don't have a dedicated 6+2 connector for GPUs.)
- **Used GTX 1650** (~$83)
- **Used RX 6400** (~$100)
- **Used Arc A380** (~$100)

### For Dedicated Power:
(i.e.: Requires a 6+2 connection from the power supply. If need be, you can pick up a [SATA to PCIe Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=sata+to+pcie+adapter) to fix this.)

- **Used RX 580** (~$40)
- **Used GTX 1660 Super** (~$80)
- **Used RTX 2060** (~$100)

::: warning
Be advised that, depending on the OEM model you choose, **you may have to opt for an SFF GPU**, such as the ones in the non-dedicated power section.
:::

::: tip
**It's helpful to upgrade the storage or memory of your OEM.** Many office PCs only come with 8GB of memory and HDD storage. Adding an extra 8GB of memory or upgrading to an SSD will vastly improve the performance of your system.

## What makes a gaming PC?

A gaming PC consists of 8 core components that each serve important functions.
Before you begin building, it's important to understand what each component does.

### CPU (Processor)

The [CPU (Central Processing Unit)](/pages/tower/cpu) is the brain of your PC and handles all the general computing tasks. It’s crucial for gaming performance, particularly in CPU-intensive games and applications.

### CPU Cooler 

The [CPU Cooler](/pages/tower/cooler) is, well, what cools the CPU. It can either be a fan (known as air cooling) or a water cooler. It prevents overheating, which can degrade performance and reduce the lifespan of your hardware.

### GPU (Graphics Card)

The [GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)](/pages/tower/gpu) is the most critical component for gaming performance. It handles rendering images, videos, and animations, making it essential for achieving high frame rates and good visual quality.

### RAM (Memory)

[RAM (Random Access Memory)](/pages/tower/ram) temporarily stores data that your CPU needs to access quickly. More RAM allows for smoother multitasking and better performance in modern games.

### Motherboard

The [Motherboard](/pages/tower/mobo) connects all components and facilitates communication between them. It also provides ports and expansion slots for additional hardware and peripherals.

### Storage (SSD/HDD)

[Storage](/pages/tower/storage) devices store your games, operating system, and files.
- **SSD (Solid-State Drive)**: Offers faster load times and quicker boot speeds, ideal for modern gaming setups.
- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Provides larger but slower storage capacity at a cheaper cost, useful for storing non-essential games, media, or other bulk files.

### PSU (Power Supply Unit)

The [PSU (Power Supply Unit)](/pages/tower/psu) converts AC power from the wall into DC power for your PC components. A reliable PSU ensures stable performance and protects against power surges.

::: warning
The PSU is the number one thing you should not cheap out on. ***Remember, this has the power to destroy everything in your build if something goes wrong***, so invest smartly.
:::

### Case

The [Case](/pages/tower/case) houses and protects all the components. It provides airflow and ventilation to maintain optimal temperatures and keeps your build organized and dust-free.

## Things to Know Before You Start

### Budget
Your budget is what you'll base your build around. PCs can be very cheap (<$400) or very expensive ($3500+), so keeping your budget in mind will help you decide what PC you'll be able to get.

### Use Case
Think about what you'll use your PC for. Here are some things you should take into account when picking your PC:

> Will I play in 1080p, 1440p, or 4K?

> Am I gonna be streaming with this PC?

> Do I plan on upgrading soon?

> Do I need WiFi/Bluetooth capabilities?

All of these questions should be taken into account when choosing your parts.

### Compatibility
Make sure your parts are compatible with each other. While PC parts are designed to be interchangeable, many components are incompatible with other parts. For example, you can't fit an large motherboard (ATX) into a Small Form Factor (SFF/ITX) case.

Here’s a comprehensive list of compatibility checks to make:
::: details

### Future-proofing
Games and apps are constantly changing. While it may be tempting to get the best value system right now, it's important to account for the future. A system built today might need upgrades sooner than others due to a lack of PSU wattage for a new GPU, for example. This should be accounted for in your part selection.

::: warning
Be careful to not overspend your budget in certain areas that will compromise the rest of your build. For example, don't spend $300 on a motherboard if it means you'll only be able to get a 4060 Ti instead of a 4070.
:::

### Prebuilts vs DIY
Prebuilt systems, while they offer worse value, will save you valuable time in building. *It's okay to purchase a prebuilt* if you believe you don't have the skills necessary to put one together yourself, if you don't have the time, or if you value a warranty. Building a PC yourself allows you to save money on build fees and you'll get to know your system better if you need to repair in the future.

| **Satisfaction**    | ✅ High satisfaction from building it yourself.     | ❌ Convenient but less personal satisfaction.        |

::: tip
Opting for a prebuilt over a DIY build **does not mean you should skip research**. It's extremely important to know what kind of performance you'd be getting for what you'd pay for, DIY or not. Don't feel like doing research? Check out the [preset guides](/pages/guides/)!
:::

### Bottlenecking
Be aware of bottlenecks in your system. A bottleneck is an instance where one component limits the capabilities of another due to being too weak. In other words, a bottleneck is the weakest point in your system. Be sure to minimize bottlenecking in your system for maximum performance.

For example, it may seem tempting to put most of your budget towards a high end GPU. However, if that results in you only being able to afford a low end CPU, that CPU will bottleneck your GPU and you will actually receieve ***less*** performance.

::: info
A bottleneck is not a bad thing. Every PC is limited by something. The goal is to minimize the bottlenecks between the components in your system to achieve the maximum performance you can get out of it.
